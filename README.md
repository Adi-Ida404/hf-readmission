Thanks for sharing the results — let’s break down what they tell you and how you might improve from here.

## 🔍 **Model Performance Summary**

### ✅ Strengths:

* **High precision for class 0** (non-positive class): 94% — good at correctly identifying majority class.
* **Decent recall for class 1** (positive class): 46% — this is a good sign; the model does find some of the minority class.
* **Feature importances are clear**, and all top features are numeric — gives clear insight for feature engineering.

### ⚠️ Weaknesses:

* **Low precision for class 1**: Only 13% → high false positive rate.
* **Low F1-score for class 1**: Just 0.21 → poor minority class performance.
* **Overall accuracy is misleadingly high (72%)** due to imbalance (194 positive vs. 2206 negative).

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics:

| Metric                   | Value  |
| ------------------------ | ------ |
| AUC-PR                   | \~0.12 |
| F1 threshold             | 0.234  |
| Minority class recall    | 46%    |
| Minority class precision | 13%    |
| Support (class 1)        | 194    |

These values suggest that the model is **struggling with the minority class**, which is **common in imbalanced datasets**.

## 🔧 What You Can Try Next

### 1. **Handle Class Imbalance Better**

* ✅ You used `scale_pos_weight=3`, which is good.
* 🔁 Try `XGBClassifier(..., scale_pos_weight = len(neg) / len(pos))` for exact balancing.
* ✅ Also try **SMOTE** or **class-balanced loss** if you're open to oversampling.

### 2. **Tune Threshold More Broadly**

You're using the threshold that maximizes F1. Consider:

* ROC and PR curve analysis for more stable threshold selection
* Adjusting for **recall prioritization** if missing class 1 is costly

### 3. **Add/Engineer Features**

The top 4 features are numeric; your categorical features are not selected. Try:

* Grouping or binning rare categories before one-hot encoding
* Adding interaction features like `age * comorbidity_count`

### 4. **Try Different Feature Selectors**

You’re using `SelectFromModel(RandomForestClassifier)` — which is tree-based. Try:

* `SelectKBest` with mutual info or chi2
* Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

### 5. **Try Simpler Models**

Sometimes, logistic regression with strong regularization can outperform XGBoost in early iterations on highly imbalanced data. Consider comparing:

* `LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced')`
* `RandomForestClassifier(class_weight='balanced')`

## 🚀 Recommended Next Step

Name this model:

> `baseline_xgb_rfselect_v1`

Then experiment with:

1. `scale_pos_weight = len(neg) / len(pos)`
2. Try without feature selection and see if AUC-PR improves
3. Compare against `LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced')`
